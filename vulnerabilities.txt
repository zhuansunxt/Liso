Consider these potential vulnerabilities:

1. Potential Buffer Overflow

   Currently the implementation chooses to map all either static file data or CGI output data to memory. If this data becomes too large, Liso server may come across potential memory overflow problem.

2, Concurrency

   Lisod can maximumly hold #FD_SETSIZE active sockets (network socket and CGI pipe descriptors), when further netowrk I/O resource is needed, Lisod will crash because of the lack of the resource.

3, Timeout not implemented

   Lisod does not implement timeout mechanism yet. So if a client sends partial request and holds a long time, Lisod will wait for this malicious client forever till further info is needed.
